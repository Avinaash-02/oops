explaination:
 code is a solution to the classic N-Queens problem, where the goal is to place n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Here’s a breakdown of the code for interview-level clarity:

Code Explanation
Class and Method Definition
class Solution: This is the main class where the solution resides.
def solveNQueens(self, n: int) -> List[List[str]]: This is the main function to solve the N-Queens problem. It takes n, the size of the chessboard, and returns a list of solutions, where each solution represents a valid arrangement of queens on the board.
Helper Function: is_safe
The helper function is_safe checks if it’s safe to place a queen at a given row and col on the board.

python
Copy code
def is_safe(board, row, col):
    for i in range(row):
        # Check if a queen is already in the same column
        if board[i] == col:
            return False
        # Check if a queen is on the same left diagonal
        if board[i] - i == col - row:
            return False
        # Check if a queen is on the same right diagonal
        if board[i] + i == col + row:
            return False
    return True
Explanation:
'''
board[i] == col: Checks if any previous queen is in the same column.
board[i] - i == col - row: Checks if any previous queen is on the same left diagonal.
board[i] + i == col + row: Checks if any previous queen is on the same right diagonal.
If none of these conditions are met, the function returns True, meaning it is safe to place a queen at (row, col).
Recursive Backtracking Function: solve
The recursive function solve attempts to place queens row by row and uses backtracking to find all valid configurations.

python
Copy code
def solve(row):
    if row == n:
        # A complete solution is found
        solutions.append(["".join(["Q" if j == col else "." for j in range(n)]) for col in board])
        return
    for col in range(n):
        if is_safe(board, row, col):
            # Place the queen
            board[row] = col
            solve(row + 1)  # Move to the next row
Explanation:

Base Case: if row == n: When all rows are filled, it means we have placed queens in a valid configuration. The solution is appended to solutions as a list of strings, where "Q" marks the queen's position and "." marks empty spaces.

Recursive Case: For each column in the current row, the algorithm:

Calls is_safe(board, row, col) to check if placing a queen at (row, col) is safe.
If safe, it sets board[row] = col, placing a queen in that column.
Calls solve(row + 1) to attempt placing a queen in the next row.
The recursion continues until all queens are placed, backtracking as needed when an invalid placement is encountered.

Solution Initialization and Output
python
Copy code
solutions = []       # Stores all valid solutions
board = [-1] * n     # Initialize board with -1, indicating no queens placed
solve(0)             # Start solving from the first row
return solutions     # Return all valid solutions
Example
For n = 4, the function would return solutions like:

css
Copy code
[ [".Q..",  "...Q",  "Q...",  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  "Q...",  "...Q",  ".Q.."]
]
Key Points for an Interview
Backtracking: This solution uses backtracking to explore all possible placements row by row and backtracks when it finds an invalid configuration.
Safety Check: is_safe is essential for ensuring no two queens threaten each other by checking columns and diagonals.
Efficiency: The solution reduces complexity by using a 1D board array where board[i] = col indicates a queen in i-th row at col-th position, simplifying row and column checks.'''
