First Come First Serve (FCFS) : Simplest scheduling algorithm that schedules according to arrival times of processes.
Shortest Job First (SJF) : Process which have the shortest burst time are scheduled first.
Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) : It is preemptive mode of SJF algorithm in which jobs are scheduled according to the shortest remaining time.
Round Robin (RR) Scheduling : Each process is assigned a fixed time, in cyclic way.
Priority Based scheduling (Non Preemptive) : In this scheduling, processes are scheduled according to their priorities, i.e., highest priority process is schedule first. If priorities of two processes match, then scheduling is according to the arrival time.
Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN) : In this scheduling, processes with highest response ratio is scheduled. This algorithm avoids starvation.
